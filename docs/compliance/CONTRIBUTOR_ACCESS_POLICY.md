# Contributor Access & Compliance Policy

This policy governs how individuals engage with the RiftLine codebase and related services. It supplements the contractual Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) signed by each collaborator and is enforceable by KlusterTech, Inc.

## Eligibility

- Only contributors who have been vetted by KlusterTech leadership and have executed the latest NDA may access this repository.
- Access is provisioned on a least-privilege basis. Contributors receive only the permissions required to fulfill their assigned responsibilities.
- Contractors and vendors must designate a KlusterTech sponsor who is accountable for their work and policy adherence.

## Onboarding Workflow

1. **Pre-screening** – Candidates undergo background and capability verification.
2. **NDA execution** – Legal agreements are signed before any assets or credentials are shared.
3. **Access provisioning** – Repository, infrastructure, and communication platform access is issued by the DevOps and Security leads.
4. **Orientation** – New contributors review the [KlusterTech Proprietary Notice](../legal/PROPRIETARY_NOTICE.md) and complete any role-specific training modules.

No development activities may commence until all onboarding steps are confirmed by the sponsor.

## Operational Expectations

- Use organization-managed accounts and hardware whenever possible.
- Keep local clones encrypted and separate from personal or open-source projects.
- Follow commit hygiene: meaningful messages, scoped changes, and timely documentation updates.
- Notify the security team before introducing new third-party dependencies, SaaS services, or data flows.
- Report security incidents, suspicious behavior, or policy violations immediately using approved escalation channels.

## Offboarding Workflow

When a contributor's engagement ends or access needs change:

1. The sponsor submits an access revocation request to DevOps and Security.
2. Credentials, tokens, and hardware are decommissioned or returned.
3. Local and cloud copies of proprietary data are securely destroyed, with confirmation sent to the sponsor.
4. Outstanding work is transitioned following the project lead's handover plan.

Compliance with these controls protects KlusterTech intellectual property and ensures RiftLine remains secure, resilient, and audit-ready.
